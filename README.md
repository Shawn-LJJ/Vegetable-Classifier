# Vegetable Type Prediction

This project is part of the submission of Deep Learning CA1 assignment from Singapore Polytechnic AY23/24.
The aim of this project is to develop two Convolution Neural Networks (one for different image size) to predict the type of the vegetable. 
The dataset provided came from an anonymous source, but due to the total size of the images, they will not be included in this repo. 
The weights of the CNN models are provided in the repo so anyone can use the weights for the models and make prediction right away, provided they resize the image.
